# homerLogin

A very simple front/back React app to login / display profile.
It aims to explain the concept to students.

This back is a Rest API coded using node.js express, MySQL, using JWT(JSON Web Token) Authentication.  
The token is saved on React using localStorage and then on redux for better security.

After cloning this project, open 2 terminals, on 1st one
```console
 cd back
 ```
 
 On second one
 ```console
 cd front
```

Then on each terminal:
```console
npm run install; npm run start
```
